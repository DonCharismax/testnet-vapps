- Project
Project: On-Chain Data Authenticator
Category: infrastructure

- Description
This vApp is a tool that allows users to generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain data. It solves the problem of data integrity and privacy by enabling users to authenticate the existence of data without revealing its content. The tool will serve as a foundational piece of infrastructure for dApps that require verifiable, private data access.

- SL Integration
The core functionality of this vApp relies on Soundness Layer's zero-knowledge proof capabilities. We will use SL to generate and verify ZK proofs, and to securely anchor the proof on-chain. The Soundness Layer will be used for its fast finality and cross-chain compatibility, which are essential for seamless data verification across different blockchains.

- Technical
Architecture
The app will consist of a simple command-line interface (CLI) or a minimal web app that interacts with the Soundness Layer API. The backend will handle the cryptographic operations and proof generation, while the frontend provides a user-friendly way to input data and receive proofs.

- Stack
1- Frontend: A minimal interface (or a CLI tool).
2- Backend: Rust or Python, as it's well-suited for cryptographic operations.
3- Blockchain: Soundness Layer (with Walrus and Sui for data availability and sequencing).
4- Storage: Off-chain data storage, with on-chain proof anchoring via SL.

- Features
1- Proof generation: Allows users to generate ZK proofs for a given piece of data.
2- Proof verification: Provides a public endpoint to verify the authenticity of a generated proof.
3- API access: An easy-to-use API for other developers to integrate the authenticator into their dApps.

Timeline
- PoC (2-4 weeks)
[x] Basic functionality for generating a simple ZK proof.
[x] SL integration for proof verification.
[x] A working CLI tool for testing.

- MVP (4-8 weeks)
[ ] Full features for more complex data types.
[ ] A web interface for broader access.
[ ] User testing and documentation.

- Innovation
This project is unique because it provides a practical tool that directly leverages the core technology of the Soundness Layer. By focusing on data authentication and privacy, it serves as a critical building block for the entire ecosystem, enabling other developers to build more secure and private applications.

- Contact
The best way to contact me is through Discord. I will also share regular updates on GitHub and Discord as the project develops.
